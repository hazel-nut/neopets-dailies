neopets-dailies
===============

Simple userscript that adds a pulldown menu with dailies and countdowns for same.

Modified version of the original script (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/158306), which is no longer maintained as of early 2013. This version adds only minor features, and a number of dailies omitted from the original.

More features to come, with the disclaimer that I'm not a web developer. :)
